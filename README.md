#### What is Luv?

**Luv** is a binding from OCaml/ReasonML to [libuv][libuv]. It looks like this:

```ocaml
let _ =
  (* Create a 1-second timer. *)
  let Ok timer = Luv.Timer.init () in
  Luv.Timer.start timer 1000 (fun () -> print_endline "Hello, world!");

  (* Run the main loop. *)
  Luv.Loop.(run (default ()) Run_mode.default)

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -package luv foo.ml *)
```

<br/>

#### What is libuv?

[libuv][libuv] is the C library in Node.js that runs Node's event loop and does
its asynchronous I/O.

<br/><br/>

Because libuv is critical to Node.js, it is [**cross-platform**][platforms] and
[**well-maintained**][maintainers]. Luv inherits these properties, taking care
of the tricky parts of calling into libuv from OCaml:

- **Memory management** &mdash; Luv keeps track of OCaml objects that have been
  passed to libuv, and are no longer otherwise retained on the OCaml side.
- **The runtime lock** &mdash; Multithreaded OCaml and libuv programs operate
  normally.
- **API problems** &mdash; Where libuv is forced to offer difficult APIs due to
  the limitations of C, Luv provides more natural APIs.
- **The build** &mdash; When Luv is installed, it builds libuv, so users don't
  have to figure out how to do it.

<br/>

Luv is usable standalone, but its main purpose is to be integrated as a back end
into bigger I/O libraries, such as [Repromise][repromise] and [Lwt][lwt]. To
that end, Luv aims to be...

- **Minimalist** &mdash; Luv only takes care of inherent libuv headaches, such
  as memory management, building as little as possible over libuv.
- **Unopinionated** &mdash; Luv avoids committing to design decisions beyond
  those dictated by libuv and OCaml.
- **Maintainable** &mdash; Luv uses [Ctypes][ctypes] to minimize the amount of C
  code in this repo, and [vendors][vendor] libuv to avoid versioning issues.

<br/>

Luv is [well-tested][tests]. Apart from checking return values and I/O behavior,
the test cases also check for memory leaks, lost references, and potential
issues with multithreading.



<br/>

## Status

Luv is an early alpha at this point. The binding covers the full libuv API
(with a few exceptions), but the library might not build in various
circumstances, lacks docs, etc. This will all be addressed in upcoming
development.



<br/>

## Trying

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aantron/luv.git
cd luv
opam install --unset-root alcotest ctypes dune result
make test
dune exec example/http_get/http_get.exe -- www.google.com
```

You can try the Luv+[Lwt][lwt] HTTP GET example by installing a couple more
dependencies:

```
opam install --unset-root lwt lwt_ppx
dune exec example/http_get_lwt/http_get_lwt.exe -- www.google.com
```

Or, for the [Repromise][repromise] version:

```
opam install --unset-root promise
dune exec example/http_get_promise/http_get_promise.exe -- www.google.com
```

Luv probably doesn't work on Windows at the moment. The code is actually highly
portable, but it is likely there are minor bugs and oversights, due to a lack of
testing on Windows. This is to be fixed in the near future :)



<br/>

## Documentation

Proper docs for Luv haven't been started yet. However, one can get a listing of
the available OCaml modules by looking in [`luv.ml`][luv.ml]. The modules are
listed in the same order as [libuv's API docs][libuv-api] list features. The
general libuv docs can be found [here][libuv-docs].

We will eventually write and generate nice HTML docs for Luv itself, with plenty
of links back to libuv :)

luv currently uses libuv 1.34.0.



<br/>

## Roadmap

- [ ] esy packaging and build.
- [x] Proof-of-concept integration with Lwt and Repromise.
- [ ] Vendor correctly Windows.
- [ ] Documentation, examples, CI; user-friendly repo.
- [ ] Look into using Luv for native Node.js modules.
